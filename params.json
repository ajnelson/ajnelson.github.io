Most other information you may want on me is available at either my [Github projects page](@ajnelson) or my [university profile page](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~ajnelson/).\r\n\r\n## Versioning\r\n\r\nGenerally, I follow the major-minor-patch[anno] versioning rules.  *Major* versions have specific milestones met in features and usability.  `1.0.0`+ is reasonably usable software.  *Minor* versions have enough new features to be genuinely useful.  `0.1.0` is an initial usable release, though might not have been run by any usability sniff-tests.  *Patch* versions are bugfixes.  Software versioned `0.0.1` is an initial proof of concept release.\r\n\r\nMost of my software is released initially as version 0.1.0.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
