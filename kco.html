        <section id="main_content">
          <p>Hello!  Occasionally, I like to go on outings to the Kennedy Center's Millenium Stage, a free performance series.  I pick shows based on my fancy and my schedule.  Company on these outings is nice, but because of the show's timing is generally hard to come by.

          <p>If you've been pointed to this page via an outing announcement I made, it's because I'd like you to know that if that show happens to also matches your fancy and your schedule, you'd have company if you came.

          <p>To announce these events to people and get rough RSVP estimates, I have taken to making private Facebook events and to texting people privately.  (I make privately-listed Event pages myself because the Kennedy Center doesn't make Facebook Events for this concert series.)  This page is to cover logistics that I didn't want to try templating and putting into every outing notice.


          <h2><a href="non-oblig" name="non-oblig"></a>Non-oblig.</h2>

          <p>If I didn't make clear when I invited you to be in this list, I'm happy to invite you, even if you have next to 0 chance of showing up to 99% of the shows.  There's no need to feel obligated.  I know 6PM on a weekday is impossible for most of us.  But if there's that one day... or, more likely, a Sunday... and you end up coming to a show that blows your socks off, I consider that a happy outcome.


          <h2><a href="logistics" name="#logistics"></a>Logistics</h2>


          <h3><a href="cost" name="#cost"></a>Cost</h3>

          <p>The Millenium Stage performances are free.


          <h3><a href="timing" name="#timing"></a>Timing</h3>

          <p>Shows start at 6PM.  On weeknights, shows run until 7PM, and then the Grand Foyer area has folks walking through for the evening theater shows that start at 7:30.  Weekend Millenium shows can run longer.

          <p>Sitting groups together can get a bit tricky.  The Kennedy Center doesn't let folks save seats for others who haven't arrived.  So it helps to be there by 10&ndash;15 minutes before the show in order to get a sufficient cluster of seats.

          <p>Seats in the back aren't really that bad in terms of audio or visual&mdash;there's a huge video display above the stage.  But, there's sometimes noise from folks walking around in the Grand Foyer area.



          <h4><a href="comms" name="#comms"></a>Comms</h4>
          <p>I've noticed some cellular providers don't have a signal that reaches into the seating area.  So, if you need to communicate with folks, it'd be best to send messages by 5:40.</p>



          <h3><a name="how-to-get-there" href="#how-to-get-there"></a>How to get there</h3>


          <h4><a name="metro" href="#metro"></a>Metro</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Stop at Foggy Bottom.</li>
            <li>If a pleasant-enough day, the walk is maybe ten minutes, passing the Watergate.</li>
            <li> If a suboptimal walking day, a free, red shuttle bus is along pretty frequently (I think every 15 minutes), picking up folks at the Foggy Bottom Metro stop.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4><a name="parking" href="#parking"></a>Parking</h4>

          <p>I know of folks who've pulled this off, but I don't know how.</p>


          <h3><a name="food" href="#food"></a>Food</h3>

          <p>Since these shows run 6-7, and some of us don't have time to eat beforehand, light dinner trekking follows the shows.  Suggestions for where to go are welcome ahead of time, but otherwise I will try to lead us to decently cheap spots.</p>


          <h2>Other shows</h2>

          <p>If you like the Millenium Stage series, their full schedule is here.  I've noticed (in fairness, through pretty infrequent observation) it seems to be updated near the end of the month, a week or month ahead of time:</p>
